“ChatGPT can answer any questions but AI needs context to answer accurately, that's why you need knowledge graphs.”  Badrouni Marwa



In this repository, I present my approach under the name Distributed knowledge graph embedding. This approach, considered among the most advanced solutions in the field of knowledge graph embedding.
The knowledge graph emerges as powerful data structures that provide a deep
representation and understanding of the knowledge presented in networks. In the
pursuit of representation learning of the knowledge graph, entities and relation-
ships undergo an embedding process, where they are mapped onto a vector space
with reduced dimensions. These embeddings are progressively used to extract
their information for a multitude of tasks in machine learning. Nevertheless, the
increase data in knowledge graph has introduced a challenge, especially as knowl-
edge graph embedding now encompass millions of nodes and billions of edges,
surpassing the capacities of existing knowledge representation learning systems.
In response to these challenge, this paper presents DistKGE, a distributed
learning approach of knowledge graph embedding based on a new partition-
ing technique. In our experimental evaluation, we illustrate that the proposed
approach improves the scalability of distributed knowledge graph learning with
respect to graph size compared to existing methods in terms of runtime perfor-
mances in the link prediction task aimed at identifying new links between entities
within the knowledge graph.
